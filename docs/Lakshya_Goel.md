## Introduction

Hello, I'm Lakshya Goel, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, Ghaziabad. One thing that really gets me excited is creating apps using Flutter. It's like giving life to ideas and making them work on your phone! I'm also learning competitive programming, which is like solving puzzles with code. Figuring out the best way to solve problems is a bit like a game for me. I'm excited about learning more and maybe even creating some really useful apps one day.
